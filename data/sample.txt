Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

There are three main types of machine learning:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

Supervised learning uses labeled data.
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns.
Reinforcement learning learns through rewards and penalties.
